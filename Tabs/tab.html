			 Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.
 			For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph 
			can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences 
			that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” 
			because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.</p>
